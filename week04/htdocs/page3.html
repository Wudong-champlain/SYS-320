    <h2>My Favorite Champion: Wukong</h2>
	<img src="images/wukong.jpg" alt="League of Legends Wukong" width="400">
    <p>In League of Legends, I mainly play <strong>Wukong Jungle</strong> and <strong>Wukong Top</strong>. 
    Wukong is fun to play because of his strong engage, tricky clone ability, and his ultimate, 
    which can turn around team fights.</p>

    <h3>Why I Like Wukong</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Great engage tool with his <strong>ultimate (Cyclone)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Can trick enemies with <strong>Decoy</strong>.</li>
        <li>Strong duelist in 1v1 fights.</li>
        <li>Very useful in both solo queue and team play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Random Fun Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes I go for early ganks when playing jungle.</li>
        <li>Top lane Wukong feels tanky and still does good damage.</li>
        <li>Building items like Black Cleaver and Divine Sunderer make him strong.</li>
        <li>I once carried a game with a 20/2/10 </li>
    </ul>
